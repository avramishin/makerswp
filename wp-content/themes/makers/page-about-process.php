Disruptive products and services are always designed by outstanding teams and founders don’t hesitate to challenge the status quo. Our vision is to provide a platform for entrepreneurs to think ahead and develop products that create true value.</p>

      <h3>1. Identify</h3>

        <h4>Explenation of the word like in some kind of dictionary</h4>
        <p>Did you know that most startups fail during the first six months? The main obstacles here include ineffecient teams, a lack of resources or failure to identify product-market fit. While success/failure of startups is oftentimes beyond our control, we believe the chances of failure should not be a stumbling block that constrains an entrepreneur’s imagination. Instead, we see it as a stepping stone to success.
        <br>
        <br>
        So we built Labs, a lean startup labaratory where ideas materialise through iteration, testing and experimentation. We seek to minimize the financial risks, while maximizing efficiency by cutting down on the feedback cycles. Labs plays a crucial part of Makers by constantly providing new ideas and insights into different markets, as well as connecting entrepreneurs to the company.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of the key questions we ask ourselves is “how can startups minimize the risks of failure?”. So we scrutinize the process of identifying a product/market fit. Once given a go-ahead, however, we execute fearlessly with an iterative, product-oriented approach and stride towards shipping minimum viable products.</p>

          An idea that sounds innovative and convincing in theory may not necessarily work in practice. That is why we believe they should always be complemented by analytics and numbers, although we are advocates of entrepreneurs’ instincts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our team at Labs consists of product managers, developers, designers as well as marketing managers who are specialists in developing and shipping MVPs. MVPs allow us to test market acceptance for unfledged business ideas, as well as helping us identify room for improvement.
          <br>
          <br>
          With Labs, we are not only able to reduce the risks of investments, but also gain tons of valuable insights through research during the process of development. The early iteration and lean company-building practices definitely set Makers apart others, and enables us to scientifically measure what others can only guess at.

          Once an idea has been tested successfully, we start looking for the right people. This may be a combination of external founders, Makers experts and new recruits with complementary skill sets. While recruiting may be time-consuming for others, Makers' dedicated HR experts and network of founders can accelerate this process dramatically. Founders are entitled to a major equity stake as well as a monthly salary. Founders are a significant part of the Makers community from day one. They get space in our office in Berlin-Mitte and are supported by our team of experts. We nurture their creativity, support their ideas and encourage collaboration.
          <br>
          <br>
          Our experience with building highly profitable companies such as Run a Shop and IconPeak convinced us of the power of bootstrapping. Making things work at low cost can test the commitment of the founders and the potential of the idea. For that reason, we encourage and enable our portfolio companies to gain user traction and first revenues before they approach potential investors.

          With Benjamin Libor, Felipe Ogibowski, Friedrich A. Neuman and Marius Schulze, Makers is managed by experienced entrepreneurs who have successfully (co-)founded market-leading companies on their own. Even established startups can benefit from their network of investors and business partners as well as from their depth of experiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          Acting as partners in crime, we support founders of our portfolio companies to scale their business in various ways:  They benefit from strategic guidance in fundraising, legal issues or human resources processes, as well as our expertise and insights.
          <br>
          <br>
          Having built companies such as BidderPlace, Run a Shop or IconPeak which are active in more 20 countries on four continents, we have outstanding knowledge in internationalizing and adapting existing business models too.
